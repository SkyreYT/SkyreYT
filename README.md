Hello, I'm Skyre! I'm currently a newbie when it comes to this whole programming world. The language that I'm learning at the moment is Python though
I want to expand my knowledge on other languages or game engines. My dream is to become a programmer and content creator in the future. My favorite things
to do are listening to music, playing retro games and well, programming!
